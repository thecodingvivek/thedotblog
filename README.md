<h1>What is thedotblog?</h1>
<p>To put it simply, this is a personal blog for my daily updates on my stupid, diabolical, useless projects, stupid philosophies, and to share my depression so that you feel better because there are people who are dumber, stupider, and have messed up their life more than you. And this blog can easily make a suicidal man feel that he is worthy to live.</p>
<h1>What is the motive?</h1>
<p>One day, I was studying for my semester exams so hard that I barely remembered what I was reading, and the only thing I wrote confidently in the exam was my name.Even the date was a big doubt for me. So, to get a good score on my next exam, I pulled a diabolical plan to stalk a topper (my roommate) during exams. I waited for the next semester exams to arrive. I observed that he was asking everyone if they wanted an explanation for each topic so that they could perform better. And I was like, "Wait, wait... why does he want to explain in the first place? Is it out of friendliness or some strategy?" Then I was enlightened by Mahesh Babu‚Äôs dialogue:"Evari mata vinoddu, manishi maata asalu vinoddu."So by thinking deeply throughout the semester, I got to know at the end that: "I have messed up this semester too."Never mind I lowkey don‚Äôt care about GPA. But what I realized at the very end is that explaining something to others helps you discover the flaws in your own understanding and also tests how deeply you understand a concept. So, as simple as that.</p> <ul> 
<li>To test my consistency</li>
<li>To check flaws in my understanding</li> <li>Blogs also help build a better portfolio (got this from a tech blog)</li> </ul>
<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
<p>For the Stack i have moved from django to nextjs because nextjs outweights the pros from django in many ways and Also i have sticked to django for a very long time And i was very familiar with react too.</p>
<p>And i have used Sanity for content managment because its super simple and no need to build a seperate dashboard for writing content this saves a lot of time for me üòÆ‚Äçüí®.</p>
<p>As most the work was taken away by sanity i think i need a seperate database like postgres again maybe firebase will be fine just for managing data like (likes,views and any other things)</p>
<p>I think i dont need any authentication for this blog as there is one person who views this blog.(that's me).and no worry for anything like for (scaling up) free tires are enough for this project so the final tech stacks are :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Next js</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Sanity</li>
    <li>Tailwindcss</li>
</ul>
<h3>i think this is not a readme file.this is also a blog üòÜ (i will move this to the blog)</h3>
