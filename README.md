<h1>What is thedotblog?</h1>
<p>To put it simply, this is a personal blog for my daily updates on my stupid, diabolical, useless projects, stupid philosophies, and to share my depression so that you feel better because there are people who are dumber, stupider, and have messed up their life more than you. And this blog can easily make a suicidal man feel that he is worthy to live.</p>
 
<h1>Tech Stack</h1>
<p>For the Stack i have moved from django to nextjs because nextjs outweights the pros from django in many ways and Also i have sticked to django for a very long time And i was very familiar with react too.</p>
<p>And i have used Sanity for content managment because its super simple and no need to build a seperate dashboard for writing content this saves a lot of time for me 😮‍💨.</p>
<p>As most the work was taken away by sanity i think i need a seperate database like postgres again maybe firebase will be fine just for managing data like (likes,views and any other things)</p>
<p>I think i dont need any authentication for this blog as there is one person who views this blog.(that's me).and no worry for anything like for (scaling up) free tires are enough for this project so the final tech stacks are :</p>
<ul>
    <li>Next js</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Sanity</li>
    <li>Tailwindcss</li>
</ul>
